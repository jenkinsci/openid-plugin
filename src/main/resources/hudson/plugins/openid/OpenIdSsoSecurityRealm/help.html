    Use one OpenID provider as the definitive authentication source to achieve SSO semantics.

    <p>
    With this option, users will be authenticated against a single external OpenID provider for
    their identities. The nick name provided by this identity provider becomes the user ID in Hudson.

    This also supports the <a href="https://dev.launchpad.net/OpenIDTeams">OpenID teams extension</a>
    so that the authorization strategy can be defined against teams.

    <p>
    Depending on how you configure the authorization, you can achieve various different semantics.
    For example, if you do "logged-in users can do anything", you can require people to login
    whenever they make changes.

    If you do "matrix-based security" and deprive the read access from anonymous users and give
    full control to the "authenticated" group, you now require everyone to be logged in all the time
    (and the sign-in process happens automatically.) Alternatively, you can give full control to
    a particular group, which restricts the use of Hudson to a subset of all the users defined in your
    OpenID provider.
