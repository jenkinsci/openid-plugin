    Specify the OpenID provider that is used for authentication.

    <p>
    This URL can be either
    <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html#terminology">OpenID provider endpoint URL</a>,
    or a representative OpenID identifier, in which case the endpoint URL will be discovered from this representative
    identifier. In other words, if you don't know what the endpoint URL is, just provide a valid OpenID in your
    provider and let Hudson figure out the rest.

    <p>
    For example, specify <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id">https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id</a> for Google
    and <a href="https://me.yahoo.com/">https://me.yahoo.com/</a> for Yahoo.
